Minimizes comments on mobile devices.

== Description ==

Minimizes the comment list and turns the comments title (eg. "3 Comments") into a trigger to view/hide the comments.

Requires no template hacking, only a knowledge of CSS selectors:

* The comments are usually inside a list with a class of ".commentlist" so you probably won't need to change the option for the "contents".
* The comments title however may be different on your theme so you may have to change the "trigger" option to something different than the "#comments-title" id. Use "Inspect element" on your post's page to deterime the correct class or id of the element you want to be the trigger.

== Installation ==

The Plugin can be installed directly from the main WordPress Plugin page.

1. Go to the Plugins => Add New page.
